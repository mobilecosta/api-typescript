## Overview üìú

**_Blog Posts API_** is a robust and scalable **API** built with **Nest.js**, **Prisma**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Swagger**. This project is designed to provide a comprehensive set of _endpoints_ for managing _blog posts_, _users_, and _authentication_, with a strong emphasis on _security_, _role-based_ access control, and efficient _data management_. The **API** supports **pagination** to handle large datasets effectively, ensuring smooth and performant operations. Additionally, the project includes **Docker** support, allowing for easy setup and deployment in containerized environments.

## Key Features üîë

- **User Management**: Users with **ADMIN** role can create an account, update and delete other users' accounts with **USER** and **MODERATOR** roles.
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication using **JWT** with support for **signin**, **signup**, **signout**, and **token refresh**.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Differentiate access and permissions based on user roles (**USER**, **MODERATOR**, **ADMIN**).
- **Guards** : Protect routes and ensure only authorized users can access specific endpoints using **Auth Guard** and **Roles Guard**.
- **Blog Posts Management**: Users can perform **CRUD** operations on their posts. Moderators can manage posts from users, and admins can manage posts from both users and moderators.
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive **API** documentation using **Swagger**.
- **Database Seeding**: Populate the database with initial data for development or testing purposes.

### User Management üë•

The **API** provides comprehensive functionality for managing _user_ accounts. Users with **ADMIN** roles can _create_, _update_, and _delete_ other users profiles with **USERS** AND **MODERATOR** roles. The following operations are supported:

- **Create Account**: Users can create a new account by providing the necessary details.

- **Update Profile**: Users can update their profile information, such as _name_, _email_, _password_ and _role_.

- **Delete Profile**: Users can delete other other users profiles with **USERS** AND **MODERATOR** roles, removing all their data from the system.

### Authentication üîè

The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, ensuring secure and stateless user sessions. The authentication system supports the following operations:

- **Signin**: Users can sign in to their accounts using their credentials. Upon successful authentication, a JWT access token and a refresh token are issued.
- **Signup**: New users can create an account by providing their details. The signup process includes validation to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Signout**: Users can sign out of their accounts, invalidating their current session.
- **Refresh**: The API supports token refresh functionality, allowing users to obtain a new access token using a valid refresh token. This ensures continuous authentication without requiring users to sign in repeatedly.

### Role-Based Access Control ‚õëÔ∏è

The API implements a robust role-based access control system, ensuring that users have appropriate permissions based on their roles. The following roles are supported:

- **User**: Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their own posts. They can also update and delete their profiles. The creation of a user account happens during the signup process.
- **Moderator**: Moderators have all the permissions of users, plus the ability to update and delete posts created by users. This role is designed to help manage content and maintain the quality of posts.
- **Admin**: Admins have all the permissions of moderators, plus the ability to update and delete posts created by moderators. This role provides full control over the content and user management.

### Guards üõ°Ô∏è

The API uses two types of guards to protect routes and ensure that only authorized users can access specific endpoints:

- **Auth Guard**: This guard ensures that only authenticated users can access certain routes. It verifies the presence and validity of the JWT access token.
- **Roles Guard**: This guard ensures that users have the appropriate role to access specific routes. It checks the user's role against the required roles for the endpoint.

### Blog Posts Management üìö

The API provides comprehensive functionality for managing blog posts. Users can create, read, update, and delete their own posts. Moderators and admins have additional privileges to manage posts created by other users. The following operations are supported:

- **Create Post**: Users can create new blog posts by providing the necessary details.
- **Read Posts**: Users can retrieve a list of all posts or a specific post by its ID. The API supports filtering and pagination to efficiently manage large datasets.
- **Update Post**: Users can update their own posts. Moderators can update posts created by users, and admins can update posts created by both users and moderators.
- **Delete Post**: Users can delete their own posts. Moderators can delete posts created by users, and admins can delete posts created by both users and moderators.

### API Documentation üìÑ

The API is documented using Swagger, providing an interactive interface to explore and test the endpoints. The documentation includes detailed information about each endpoint, including the request parameters, response structure, and possible status codes. This makes it easy for developers to understand and integrate with the API. The documentation also covers pagination, explaining how to use the skip and take parameters to efficiently manage large datasets.

The **Swagger UI** will be available on **/v1/api/docs** route.

### Database Seeding üå±

The API includes functionality for seeding the database with initial data. This is useful for setting up a development environment or for testing purposes. The following operations are supported:

#### Seed Command:

To populate your database with initial data, use the following command:

```bash
npm run prisma:seed
```

This command will execute the seed script, allowing you to set up initial data for development or testing purposes. It will have user with email: "**_test_user@example.com_**" and password "**Password123.**" with **ADMIN** role, and also 3 other users (one for every role: **_ADMIN_**, **_MODERATOR_**, adn **_USER_**), and every user will have 3 posts. If you are running project with Docker, then this script will run on initialization and you can test the the **signin** endoint with "**Test User**" creadentials provided above.

#### Benefits of Database Seeding:

- Consistent Development Environment: Ensures that all developers have the same initial data, reducing discrepancies and bugs.

- Testing: Provides a reliable dataset for testing, ensuring that tests are run against known data.

- Demo Data: Allows you to quickly set up demo data for presentations or client demonstrations

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NikolaJohnny94/nestjs-prisma-postgres-auth-api.git
   cd nestjs-prisma-postgres-auth-api
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:**

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=your_db_url
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Run database migrations:**

   ```bash
   npm run prisma:migrate:dev --name init
   ```

5. **Generate Prisma client:**

   ```bash
   npm run prisma:generate
   ```

## Run the project üöÄ

**Start the application:**

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

If you run the project locally, the **API** will be available at **http://localhost:3000/v1/api**

## Run the project with Docker üêã

**Set up environment variables:**
<br/>Create a **_.env.docker.local_** file in the root directory and add the following _variables_:

```bash
POSTGRES_USER=your_db_username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password
POSTGRES_DB=your_db_name
DATABASE_URL=your_db_url
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

**Build the images:**

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.docker.local build
```

**Creating and starting the containers:**

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.docker.local up
```

If you run the project locally, the **API** will be available on **http://localhost/v1/api** thanks to the [**_nginx_**](https://nginx.org/en/) that is set up as service in _docker-compose_ file. **Nginx** acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests from **_http://localhost/v1/api_** to the appropriate service running inside the **Docker** container. This setup allows you to access your **API** through a single, consistent **URL**, even if the underlying services are running on different ports.
